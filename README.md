I'm Mads and I am an electronic music composer and software developer. I enjoy working with audio software and hardware. I live in Copenhagen, Denmark and produce electronic music, read books and drink tea. ðŸŒ±

Most of my projects on here are related to digital sound, interactive art and the tools to create both of those.
