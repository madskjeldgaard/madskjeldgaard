I'm Mads and I am an electronic music composer and software developer. My day job is as a software developer at [Torso Electronics](https://torsoelectronics.com/) where I help develop musical instruments for the future. I live in Copenhagen, Denmark and produce electronic music, read books and drink tea ðŸŒ±

Most of my projects on here are related to digital sound, interactive art and the tools to create both of those.
